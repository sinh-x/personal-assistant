MODE: DAILY PROGRESS (mid-day)
TARGET_DATE: {{TODAY}}

Check progress toward the plan for {{TODAY}}.

Workflow:

   - session-gatherer: read TODAY's sessions so far
   - jsonl-analyst: get today's JSONL stats so far
   - time-tracker: get avo current status, plan vs actual so far
2. Once all three are done, spawn synthesizer with their data and this instruction:
   - Read today's plan from {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/{{TODAY}}-plan.md
   - Compare planned goals vs actual activity
   - Produce a progress report

Output: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/{{TODAY}}-progress.md
